   d12 TABLE SYSTEM:
   Abilities with tabla:true are resolved by rolling 1d12 after paying Aen.
   Bands: b1 (1-4) · b2 (5-8) · b3 (9-11) · b12 (12 = maximum effect)
   PUSH SYSTEM (Echo):
   Echo = class echoBase (Might 1 / Magic 2) + kit aenBonus. Static; the DM never
   grants or removes Echo. Charges: Echo 1-2 -> 2, 3-4 -> 3, 5 -> 4; recover when
   the session ends; the DM may burn charges narratively, never grant above max.
   After rolling the d12 you may declare ONE push to a higher band: spend 1 charge
   on declaration, roll d20+Echo vs the target band reach (5-8:15 / 9-11:17 / 12:20).
   Reach it -> read the target band. Fall short -> pay the shortfall in Vitality and
   arrive anyway, or let go and keep your rolled band. Table abilities and legendary
   weapons only. Enemies cannot push.
